# INFO6255 Selenium Project

## Project Requirements

This project involves developing a Selenium-based testing framework with specific guidelines to ensure automation and repeatability.

### Setup and Configuration
- Utilize **Maven** as your project management and comprehension tool.
- Add necessary dependencies in your `pom.xml`.

### Testing and Execution
- **Screenshots**: Capture screenshots before and after every successfully executed step, and save them in a folder named after the scenario.
- **Automation**: Ensure that after a scenario is executed, the next scenario runs automatically without manual intervention.
- **Programming Language**: You may use either Java or Python for scripting.
- **Assertions**: Implement correct assertions throughout to validate test results against expected outcomes.

### Framework and Data Handling
- Employ a **Data-Driven Automation Framework** for scripting. Avoid hard-coded values.
- Utilize an **Excel data file** for any required test data to ensure flexibility and reusability of test scripts.

### Reporting
- Generate an HTML report detailing the outcomes of test scenarios, including columns for:
  - Test scenario name
  - Actual results
  - Expected results
  - Pass/Fail status
- Alternative reporting methods are acceptable if they provide equal or better clarity and detail.

### Two-Factor Authentication Handling
- **Manual Interaction**: You are allowed to manually hit the enter key once during your session for two-factor authentication. No other manual interventions are acceptable.

## Team Presentations
- **Submission**: Upload one copy of your script to the Assignment on Canvas before class.
- **Presentation**: Each group will be called randomly to present their Selenium script, which should not exceed 10 minutes.
- **Demonstration**: Select one representative from your group to demo the script in class. The script should run seamlessly without any interruptions (except for the allowed manual interaction for two-factor authentication).
- **Code Quality**: Practice good coding techniques, including appropriate comments in the code.

### Participation
- All group members must actively participate in the presentation and be prepared to answer questions regarding the project.

## Notes
- This project is designed to assess your ability to integrate Selenium with various tools and frameworks to create a robust automated testing environment. Focus on delivering a solution that adheres to professional standards and demonstrates thorough understanding of automated testing principles.
